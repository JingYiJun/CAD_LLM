The design consists of three main parts. The first part is a rectangular prism with a length of approximately zero point one one four nine meters, a width of zero point zero seven one eight meters, and a height of zero point zero four three one meters. This part is positioned with a slight offset and rotation. The second part is a long, slender cylindrical shape with a length of around zero point two zero one one meters, a width of zero point zero one seven two meters, and a height of zero point zero zero five seven meters. This part is also slightly offset and rotated. The third part is a cylinder with a curved top, measuring about zero point four eight four one meters in length, zero point one one five two meters in width, and zero point zero three four five meters in height. This part is positioned at the base of the assembly. All parts are oriented similarly and assembled to form a complex, multi-part structure.
